# Deep learning, projects

This is our repository for the mini-projects of the [EPFL course Deep Learning](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/deep-learning-EE-559 "EPFL - Deep Learning").

The two projects were to be done with Python. The course actually had [super good ressources available](https://fleuret.org/dlc/ "François Fleuret - Deep Learning course resources"), courtesy of François Fleuret. Please read the ee559-miniprojects.pdf for a description of the miniprojects.
