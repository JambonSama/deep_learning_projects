\section{Introduction}

The objective of this project is to compare different deep networks architectures. 
Each network aims to compare two digits, represented each on a 14x14 greyscale single channel image. 
The networks should predict for each pair whether the first digit is lesser or equal to the second.
Thus, the networks' input is a 2x14x14 tensor, and their output consists of two classes.

In particular, the architectures comparison should quantitatively assess the merits of using weight sharing and / or auxiliary losses (or none).

To that end, four architectures are to be implemented. 
They should have similar layers, though not used in the same way, so that the comparison is actually relevant. 
Comparisons should be based on estimated final accuracy, estimated required epoch number for "good training" and epoch training duration. 
For the results to hold statistical values, performance should be estimated on $N$ rounds.
