\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this project is to design and program a mini "deep learning framework" using only pythorch's tensor operation and standard math library. The program have to be able to compute a neural network with two input and two output with three hidden layers of 25 neurons each. The neural network can have fully connected Linear, TanH or ReLu layers and use a stochastic gradient descent with the mean square error to optimize the parameter.
