\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this project is to design and program a mini "deep learning framework" using only pythorch's tensor operation and standard maths packages. The program should be able to compute a neural network with two inputs and two outputs with three hidden layers of 25 neurons each. The neural network should be able to provide fully connected Linear, TanH or ReLu layers and use a stochastic gradient descent with the mean square error to optimize the parameters.
